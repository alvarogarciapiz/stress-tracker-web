      <h1 className={styles.title}>How HRV Tracking on Apple Watch Can Help You Reduce Stress</h1>
      <h2 className={styles.subtitle}>Learn how heart rate variability (HRV) data from your Apple Watch provides actionable insights into your stress levels and recovery patterns.</h2>
      <div className={styles.body}>
        <p>
          Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a groundbreaking metric that has become a key tool for understanding and managing stress. The Apple Watch uses advanced sensors to track HRV, providing users with insights into their autonomic nervous system, which governs the body’s stress response. By interpreting HRV data, you can gain a clearer picture of your stress levels and overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          HRV reflects the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. A higher HRV generally indicates a balanced autonomic nervous system, where both the sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) systems are functioning well. Studies have shown that chronic stress lowers HRV, while relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness can improve it. The Apple Watch translates this complex data into an actionable stress score, allowing you to track patterns over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking HRV through an app like our <strong>Stress App</strong> adds an additional layer of context. We provide a daily stress score, weekly trends, and a recovery index based on HRV and sleep data. These features help you identify when stress is peaking and when your body is successfully recovering. This kind of insight is invaluable for those juggling demanding lifestyles or aiming to optimize their mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond just monitoring, HRV data can inspire lifestyle changes. By correlating HRV with your activities, sleep quality, or relaxation routines, you can identify what helps reduce stress effectively. Whether it’s prioritizing restorative sleep, incorporating mindfulness exercises, or adjusting your workout intensity, the Apple Watch equips you with the knowledge to make informed decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incorporating HRV tracking into your daily routine is not just about reducing stress—it’s about building resilience. With tools like the Apple Watch and apps designed to interpret HRV, you can take a proactive approach to your mental and physical health, ensuring a more balanced and stress-free life.
